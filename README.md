Set operations with OOP

You can create polymorphic set classes with OOP, and you can do several operations on it.

1. operator+
Returns the union of the left set and the right set.

2. operator-
Returns the difference of the left set from the right set

3. operator==
Compares the two sets and return true if they are the same. Otherwise, returns false.

4. operator!=
Compares the two sets and returns true if they are not the same. Otherwise, returns false.

5. operator=
Copies the contents of the right set to the left set.

6. operator+=
Performs the union of two sets and stores the result in set which is at the left hand side of the equality. Also returns the union of the two sets.

7. operator<
Returns true only if the set on the left is a subset of the set on the right. Otherwise, returns false.
8. operator<<
Output the contents of the set.

9. operator>>
Fills in the empty places in the set so that the number of elements in the set is equal to the capacity of the set.
